#+TITLE: company-zetteltags

A company-mode backend for autocompleting tags in your [[https://www.eliasstorms.net/zetteldeft/][Zetteldeft-based]] Zettelkasten.

* Usage
  To use it, you’ll naturally need [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]] and [[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft][zetteldeft]].

** To load it:
: (require 'company-zetteltags)
: (company-zetteltags-init)

** Or, to add it on the fly:
: M-x company-zetteltags-enable

If you use this method, you can disable it, too:
: M-x company-zetteltags-disable

** Or, add it to =company-backends= in your =init.el=:
: (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-zetteltags)

* Config

Since the backend is hooked directly into the Zetteldeft variable =zetteldeft-tag-regex=, any completion will come after typing in whatever you’ve set for that. You can change that with =M-x customize-variable zetteldeft-tag-regex= or by placing =(setq zetteldeft-tag-regex "<your-favourite-regex>")= in your =init.el=.

* To do:
+ Make it so that the function doesn't query the entire list of tags as completion candidates before narrowing.

  I'm new to the lisps. Any improvements or suggestions are welcome!
